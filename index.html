    <h5 class="card-title">What You Need To Know!!!</h5>
    <p class="card-text">There are many different types of snakes around the globe, and they may be found almost anywhere. Snakes are reptiles that lack limbs, a voice, eyelids, and ears. They have long, slender bodies coated in scales. Snakes have mouths that open widely, allowing them to consume prey twice their size. They only move by crawling everywhere. Snake patterns fall into four categories: banded, uniform coloration, spotted, and striped lengthwise. Although there are over 3000 species of snakes, only 400 are venomous. Be mindful when running into any snakes!

      <h5 class="card-title">Banded</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Banded snakes are a group of snakes that are characterized by distinctive bands or stripes running along their bodies. These bands can be of different colors and patterns, depending on the species. Banded snakes are found in various parts of the world and belong to different categorized families. One well-known example of a banded snake is the Banded Krait, which is native to Southeast Asia. It has a glossy black body with distinctive yellow or white bands surrounding its body. Banded Kraits are venomous and are known for their impressive neurotoxic venom. Another example is the Banded Water Snake, also known as the Northern Water Snake. It is found in North America and has dark bands that run across its body. Banded Water Snakes are non-venomous and are commonly found near freshwater habitats like rivers, lakes, and marshes.

      <h5 class="card-title">Uniform Coloration</h5>
      <p class="card-text">When a snake has uniform coloration, it means that its entire body has the same shade or color throughout, with no obvious patterns or markings. While many snake species use different patterns and colors to help them blend in or stand out, certain snake species have a consistent hue all over their bodies. Some examples are: 
-Many brown snake species, like the Eastern brown snake, are all the same shade of brown. In places like dry grasslands or deserts, where the brown hue mixes with the surroundings, this helps them efficiently disguise.
-Some black snake species, like the black rat snake, have a solid black color. This may be an adaptation for hiding in dark places where they hunt for prey or look for shelter, like tree trunks or rocky crevices.
-Many green snake species, like the Asian Green Vine Snake, are entirely green from head to tail. As a result, they are more difficult to notice since they mix in with the vegetation in their native habitat.

      <h5 class="card-title">Spotted</h5>
      <p class="card-text"> Spotted snakes are a diverse group of snakes that display a spotted pattern on their bodies. The spots can vary in size, shape, and color, depending on the species. One example of a spotted snake is the African rock python, which can be found in sub-Saharan Africa. This large constrictor snake has a background color ranging from light tan to dark brown, with dark brown or black spots covering its body. African rock pythons are non-venomous and are known for their impressive size and strength. Another example is the western diamondback rattlesnake, found in North America. This venomous snake has a distinctive diamond-shaped pattern along its body, consisting of dark brown or black spots on a lighter background color. The spots create a banded appearance, and the snake's tail typically has black and white bands. Western diamondback rattlesnakes are known for their rattles and can deliver a potent venomous bite if threatened.

      <h5 class="card-title">Striped Lengthwise</h5>
      <p class="card-text">The vast majority of snakes with striped stripes are harmless. They are occasionally mistaken for garden snakes, but are actually 'garter' snakes. They are rarely a severe threat to people. They have venomous bites and back fangs. They only bite if they are threatened. The majority are not venomous, but some are. As a result, if you come across one, proceed with caution. Most importantly, be careful when seeing snakes with red and black stripes! These snakes can be incredibly dangerous or completely harmless, but you must know how to distinguish between the two. </p>
